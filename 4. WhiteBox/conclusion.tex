\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item White box testing techniques analyze the internal structures the used data structures, internal design, code structure and the working of the software rather than just the functionality as in black box testing. 
	\item This method is named so because it is the internal part what is tested and its work flow, also the tester has access to it;
	\item White box testing is very thorough as the entire code and structures are tested.
	\item It results in the optimization of code removing error and helps in removing extra lines of code.
	\item Yet it has its disadvantages e.g. it is expensive, also testers are required to have in-depth knowledge of the code and programming language as opposed to black box testing.
\end{itemize}
