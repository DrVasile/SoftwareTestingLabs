\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Black box testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design of the item being tested is not known to the tester;
	\item This method is named so because the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a black box inside which one cannot see;
	\item This method has an advantage that tester doesn't need to know programming languages or how the software has been implemented;
	\item Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete;
	\item But the method has its disadvantages, for example without clear specifications, test cases will be difficult to design;
	\item Also, only a small number of possible inputs can be tested and many program paths will be left untested; 
\end{itemize}
